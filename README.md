## Installation
Install using pip

```bash
$ pip3 install plutto
```
*Note:* This SDK requires [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

## Usage
With this SDK we want to provide a wrapper to the [Plutto API](https://docs.getplutto.com/reference/get_customers) with a very intuitive way of use. All the methods were implemented as in the API documentation, reading it will enable you to use this SDK

### Quickstart
First of all, you will need a [Plutto] account. After creating it, you can get your API key, which will let you to use the `Plutto` object. Then, you're ready to use this awesome SDK!

```python
from plutto import Plutto

client = Plutto("your_api_key")
```

### Managers
How to manage the resources getted by the SDK? Easy, **managers** (_big brain time_). **Managers** are the python objects that will let you work with any resource, obviously, inside the Plutto API. All the existing **managers** are inside the `Plutto` object. These are:
- `customers`
- `invoices`
- `meter_events`
- `permission_groups`
- `products`
- `subscriptions`
